HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics

What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's used to create the structure of web pages. 
It tells the browser how to display content like text, images, links, and more.

Basic Structure of an HTML Page

A basic HTML page includes:

<!DOCTYPE html> to tell the browser we're using HTML5.
<html> as the root element.
<head> for metadata like the page title and CSS links.
<body> for everything that's visible on the web page.


Difference Between Inline and Block Elements

Block-level elements: Take up the full width of the page. Always start on a new line.
Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>

Inline elements: Only take up as much space as the content inside. Don’t start on a new line.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>
In short, block elements stack vertically, while inline elements flow horizontally within a block.

CSS

Ways to Add CSS
There are 3 main ways to use CSS:
Inline CSS – styles are written directly in an HTML tag (not ideal for larger projects).
Internal CSS – inside a <style> tag in the HTML file.
External CSS – in a separate .css file linked to the HTML.
Preferred method: External CSS.

CSS Selectors: Element, Class, and ID
Element selector: targets all instances of an element.
Example: p { color: blue; } (makes all <p> tags blue)

Class selector: reusable across multiple elements.
Example: .highlight { background-color: yellow; }

ID selector: used for a unique element.
Example: #header { font-size: 24px; }

JavaScript

Ways to Add JavaScript

JavaScript can be added in 3 ways:
Inline – directly inside an HTML tag (onclick, etc.)
Internal – inside a <script> tag in the HTML file
External – linked via a .js file (this is best)
Preferred method: External JS files. It's cleaner, keeps the logic separate, and makes the code easier to update or reuse.
